        <h3>
            Tyler’s strengths lie in laying the groundwork for projects, 
            keeping them on a productive path, and considering unlikely 
            angles. Starting from ground zero is something he has experience 
            with as a business owner and progressing entrepreneur. Tyler 
            creates infrastructure for his teams that facilitates clear 
            communication, shared purpose, and awareness of the design 
            space. He thrives on physical design projects with a strong 
            focus on the user’s experience.

        <h4>
            Casey is passionate about making life work better for humans 
            through service and process design in the healthcare sector. 
            Understanding the intricacies of team dynamics, Casey excels 
            at grounding her team and fostering an environment where 
            everyone feels valued and motivated. She uses encouragement 
            and empowerment to orchestrate teams for maximum efficiency 
            and fun. Her quest to make a meaningful impact in people’s 
            lives is the driving force behind her work, and she constantly 
            seeks opportunities to contribute positively to the well-being 
            of others.

    <h2>René Capella</h2>
    <div class="profile">
        <img src="images/Profiles/ReneSquare.jpg" />
        <h5>
            René’s strongest contributions are critical analysis, managing 
            large systems, and conceptualizing nuanced and novel solutions.
            Exhausting all options in pursuing creativity and possibility 
            is important to René, as demonstrated in their projects and 
            installation artwork. Interested in solving ‘wicked’ problems 
            (the most embedded, long-term issues we face), René pursues 
            long-term design approaches informed by discursive and 
            transitional design theory to meditate on market-based, 
            globally beneficial products. Designing systemic, 
            ecologically-minded, generative systems is their driving 
            motivation in the Human-Centered Design & Engineering capstone 
            project with PATH.

    <h2>Sam Ferguson</h2>
    <div class="profile">
        <img src="images/Profiles/SamSquare.jpg" />
        <h6>
            Sam enjoys working with people. This may come in the form of 
            conducting qualitative research or managing stakeholders. 
            Another strength is analyzing research, both primary and 
            secondary. Finding a strategy that considers humans (users, 
            stakeholders), as well as system constraints (economic, 
            policy), is what he loves to do most. His hard skills lean 
            towards engineering, modeling, and fabricating physical 
            prototypes. A goal of this project would be to exercise his 
            ability to understand and design within complex systems.
